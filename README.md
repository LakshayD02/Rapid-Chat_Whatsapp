# Rapid-Chat_Whatsapp
Rapidchat, Rapid WhatsApp is a React-based project designed to streamline the initiation of conversations on WhatsApp without the need to save contacts in your phone's directory.
The project allows users to enter a phone number directly into the app, click on "chat," and then be taken directly to that person's WhatsApp chat window without the need to save their number in their phone's contacts list. Additionally, Rapid WhatsApp includes the ability to save contacts directly in your browser's local storage. The WhatsApp API serves as the backbone of the website's functionality, enabling the generation of links or triggers that initiate conversations with specific phone numbers, enhancing user convenience and efficiency in initiating conversations on the popular messaging platform.
